That's a weird-looking squirrel
These youngsters are taking "Squid Game" a bit too far...
This is the unfunniest comment I have ever read
Yeah it's an octopus not a squid
You've never seen a Lexus before?
How sad. What a waste.
Yeah, even sadder knowing how smart these little guys are. Not that I don't care about less-intelligent animals but like... I bet that octopus had an entire personality
Iâ€™m not a vegetarian. One way I have peace with being a meat eater is respect for the animals I eat.
They're seriously impressive in terms of neurological capability and reasoning. Like, I found it hard to believe how intelligent they are. Not sure if you care that much but [this video](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=mFP_AjJeP-M) was enlightening for me
I understand the appeal of throwing an octopus, but arenâ€™t Red Wings fans supposed to do that at a hockey arena?
Please tell me this is not Lego octopus!
What in tarnation is lego octopus
Eight legs, riiiight?
You sound like two horses
This is sad. People are scum for doing this.
For dropping an octopus they bought to eat?
It is a waste of Life & Energy, independent any individual perception.
Could have very well died on its own anyway at least it's food for other animals now. It's not wasted at all
What if that was your pet or evoked an emotional response in you? Don't need to be so objective all the time
It's not my pet octopus.  No point in hypotheticals
Either you're being sarcastic here or are extremely self-unaware ðŸ¤£
Lmao just fucking around. Surprised people are so upset about an octopus of all things. People drop food it happens.
People drop garbage, destroy the system that makes us possible. It happens, (or get this)... doesn't have to.

You state, "at least it's food for other animals now". I think you mean "at most". It's promising you are starting to understand caloric potential through biodegradation. Also, the medium in which, "energy" redistribution takes place (pulling from ocean to decay on land), could be fairly debated, as avian creatures do tend to be very beneficial to societal development.

The loss I refer to, is mostly an economic point. Its also, one of environmental conservation, while safeguarding against moral decline. 

Cumulative costs and time allocated for the fishing, shipping, handling and equipment, become congested when the product does not reach the intended target. additionally, every person who witnessed the waste (in person or in this thread) probably decided to skip on the octopus they may have otherwise subsequentially ordered. Seafood is already WAY pricey here in the midwest; cost will rise when less people consume it. 

Broken Window Theory applies here just as much as the Butterfly Effect (cause/effect).

Will this one microevent even matter? Doesn't seem so, but humans are HORRIBLE at assessing far-reaching consequences. So, maybe just wait. If enough folks get numb to this idea (blissfully wasteful consumerism), then we, as a people, will witness the collapse of the global economy, indisputably.

"All that from a dead octopus?"

Well, Gandhi pleaded for us to BE the change we wish of the world. Right now, many people are ready for this world to be over. To them I say, "refuse help? refuse To help? Then please, exit the room & don't bring US down with you."

Its upon US to identify and bring-to-attention, ALL reckless behavior. Because, if we cannot grow as as species ourselves, than the story of mankind is an open/shut case, like our dead friend in the picture.
Mistakes happen man even if all that is wasted there's going to be some things that happen. You really think someone bought this and was like yeah fuck it imma throw it on the ground. Get your head out your ass. If it was some shit like garbage sure I get it but this is food. I guarantee no one bought that shit and full sent that shit out a window or what ever. Like 5% chance lol cuz some humans are dumb.
I mean it is pretty sad that this creature had to lose its life to become pigeon food.
This is what happens when you don't give your octopus Legos they can play with during winter break
He went out to get some for himselfâ€¦ never came back
okay who got the DOD grant contract to expand bird drones into sea life?
We actually did lmaooo: CyberOctopus - https://cyberoctopus.csl.illinois.edu/

White st
Still there?
No, cleaned up at some point.
White and what???  We got a very similar looking octopus at county market ðŸ˜‚ long shot but Iâ€™m not seeing any details on the head so it looks like the prepared one we had in the case
:O White and the block between 3rd and 4th
Hahaha no shit, thatâ€™s pretty close Iâ€™ll check if itâ€™s in the case tomorrow I guess lmfao thatâ€™s an expensive ass piece of litter!  But glad that it was dead prior to hitting the pavement
How much does an octopus cost????
The squid was gone today :0 someone purchased it in the last two days
I was wondering about this!!!! Thanks for checking in. It's gotta be the one
Iâ€™m getting recommended posts from r/Splatoon on this post. Reddit pls
But why is it holding a piece of cheese
Dear Prof. Tired,

I think the cheese you are seeing is in fact a leaf.

Thanks!

chell0wFTW
I like how a subreddit reply about squid and its cheese/a leaf is written more professionally than any of my actual student emails.
Mom can we have sushi? We have sushi at home.
HAVE YOU NEVER SEEN A HEN WEARING A TIE?

Honestly, i dont mind this macot at all lolol we should name him sir Maize Cornelius. But i cannot say for team soybean.... They might prefer sir Glycine Maximilian
While this would pose problems when we play against Nebraska, I for one welcome Sir Morrow
When he's not defending the Morrow Plots he's guarding the endzone
Obvi heâ€™s plowing them husky girls erry day too
Everyday he tasselling
u/UIUC_PERVERT approves.

I would take this any day over Kingfisher or Alma Otter.
At least this way when our mascot encounters Nebraska's Cornhusker it will make sense canonically
THIS IS COOOOOL. Proper representation and I think this is soooooo much better than having no mascotðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚. We should start polling for a name for this.
Haha I love the names that have come up in the comments thus far
I posted the "Morrow Tapestry" depicting the duel between Sir Cornelius Mayz and Glycine Maximilian, circa 2022. Check it out in r/UIUC
It's beautiful omg. I can only imagine what the lore behind Sir Cornelius would be
PLEASE START A CHANGE.ORG PETITION!!
[deleted]
Iâ€™ve been saying our mascot should be an ear of corn since getting to U of I! Letâ€™s do it!!
ðŸ˜‚ But how?? Are mascot votes even a thing? It's been a few years since I graduated so not sure what the deal is with that recently..
Honestly it should be a soybean
You should look up the connection between the University Of Illinois and sweetcorn
I know Iâ€™m in crop sci, haha
I see I'm not the only one who got off the wait list this morning :P
